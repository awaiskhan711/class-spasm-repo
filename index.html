    <h2>what is htmly ?</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables</p>
    <h2>why we are using it ? </h2>
    <p>It provides a structure for web pages that allows browsers to understand and display the content on the page. </p>
    <h2>what is teg ?</h2>
    <p>It seems like you're referring to "HTML TEG," but this combination doesn't appear to be widely recognized or standard in web development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web, and "TEG" in this context might be a typo or confusion with some other concept.

        However, if you're referring to a different technical term or concept that might involve "TEG" in the context of HTML or web development, please clarify! It might also be worth checking if "TEG" is an acronym for a specific framework, tag, or technology related to HTML or web tools.</p>
